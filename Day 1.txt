JSX:-
	-It stands for javascript xml.
	-It gives more features than vanilla javascript.
	-It is case sensitive and it use camel case for elements and class name.
	
real DOM:-
	-Real DOM things changes directly whats on the screen.
	-It is what shows on browsers page.
	
Virtual DOM:-
	-It lacks the real things power to directly change whats on the screen.
	
	
In React used virtual DOM it means that it does not render all the component, 
It just render the component in which changes had been made And rest of components are as it is.
This is the main advantage of react means we cant load whole website when we change one component this one should render again.
